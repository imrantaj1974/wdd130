                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>While river rafting and kayaking adventure in Pakistan may not be as popular as in some other countries. It has been attracting adventure seekers since the 1980s. Pakistan offers access to a variety of rivers, with the potential for first descents and challenging paddling experiences. There’s more to explore beyond the well-known Rhondu Gorges, and the locals are known for their friendliness.</p>
